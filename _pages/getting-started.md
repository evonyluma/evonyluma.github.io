### Step 1) Change your Monarch name

At first, your player name will be Monarch12345678 or similar. This name is complicated to identify and also makes you an open
target on the server. Do yourself a favor, and go change it. Now.

### Step 2) Hide your Monarch gear and VIP status

It is a good idea to reveal as little information on your power as possible to other players. Equipments and VIP status give a
pretty good indication of your level and buffs, making it easier for attackers to exploit your weak points.

To do this, from the game screen:
1. Click the three-dots menu on the right side
2. Select the _Settings_ icon
3. Select the _Options_ menu item (third from the top)
4. In the _Monarch Gear Settings_ box, make sure the toggle is set to "disabled"
5. In the _VIP Level Settings_ box, make sure the toggle is set to "disabled"

Your options screen should look like that:

### Step 3) Read the Alliance Rules

Read the Alliance Rules. Now read them again. Any offense to those rules can result in your immediate eviction from the Alliance.
You have been warned!

## Step 4) Say Hello on the Alliance Chat

Don't be a stranger! The Chat is where we bond together, exchange monsters and players spotting, and help each other. So come
say Hello and introduce yourself!
