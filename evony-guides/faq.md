## How do I know if it is Kill Enemies (KE) yet?

Kill Enemies (KE) is the only time where attacking each other cities is allowed (and even encouraged).
It typically lasts 3 days (but it can be 1 or 4 also).

KE is the 5th phase of the periodic **Monarch Competition** event, you can see it in the Event Center
(one of the buttons on the top right of your screen).

So:
* it is KE if the Monarch Competition event shows **5/5 Kill Enemies** in the subtitle
* below you have a counter indicating how much time is left before the end of KE
* if the Monarch Competition event shows **4/5** then when this one ends, KE starts
