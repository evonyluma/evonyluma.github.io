_revised on June 16th, 2022: clarify rule#2 and list a safe distance for summoning Fenrirs_

Do not hesitate to ask for any clarification!

1. Respect your Queen

2. No Fenrir attacks whithin the hive or immediate vicinity. The reason for this being that when you kill a fenrir,
reward chests will appear and if you are too close to the hive, they will land inside the hive and may take someone's
assigned spot. A safe distance of approximately 50km from the hive has been established. Please teleport to that
distance and then summon all you want. This will make sure no chest appear in the hive but still be close enough for
members to run to claim the reward chests.

3. Donate at least one march of resources, each day, to the alliance warehouse. This helps our alliance grow.

4. Donate to alliance science as well. You can do it with minimal resources every 4 hours. Please do it as often
as you can. We all share the buffs it gives.

5. For monster rallies send 1 general and 1 troop only. (Recommend Cavalry)

6. Check email and alliance chat (AC) regularly for updates.

7. Have fun and enjoy yourself

8. Always refer back to rule #1.

Thank you for your attention to those rules.

Happy to have you as part of the TOR family!
