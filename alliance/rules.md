# TOR Alliance Rules

_revised on June 8th, 2022: point #4 about Alliance donations_

1. Respect your Queen
2. No Fenrir attacks whithin the hive or immediate vicinity (we want to leave space for the everyone to be able to port away and get back home).
3. Donate at least one march of resources, each day, to the alliance warehouse. This helps our alliance grow.
4. Donate to alliance science as well. You can do it with minimal resources every 4 hours. Please do it as often
as you can. We all share the buffs it gives.
5. For monster rallies send 1 general and 1 troop only. (Recommend Cavalry)
6. Check email and alliance chat (AC) regularly for updates.
7. Have fun and enjoy yourself
8. Always refer back to rule #1.
